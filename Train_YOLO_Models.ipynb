Larger models run slower but have higher accuracy, while smaller models run faster but have lower accuracy. I made a brief YouTube video that compares performance of different YOLO models on a Raspberry Pi 5 and a laptop with a RTX 4050 GPU, [check it out here to get a sense of their speed accuracy](https://youtu.be/_WKS4E9SmkA).
